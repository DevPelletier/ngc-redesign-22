            For Purolator and Canada Post deliveries, if no one is home to sign for the package, a delivery slip will be left. The package will then be taken to the carrierâ€™s nearest depot. Refer to this slip for the date of pickup and location of your package.</p>
            <p>Please note that if your package is left too long at the depot (usually 2 weeks), it will be sent back to our facility to be destroyed. At this point, no refund will be issued.
