            <h2>Is Medical Cannabis Right for Me?</h2>
            <p>Ever since recreational legalization in Canada in 2018, there has been a lot of buzz about the cannabis plant. However, medical cannabis use has been legal in Canada for over 20 years (since 2001), and medicinal use of the cannabis plant can be traced back for hundreds of years, at least.</p>
            <p>Every year, more Canadian healthcare professionals and patients are using the growing volumes of clinical research and data to make informed decisions about medicinal cannabis for patients' specific ailments.</p>
            <br /><br />
            <p>Before starting any new therapy, itâ€™s important that a patient get all the facts - and, of course, to talk with a trusted Healthcare Professional. At Northern Green, we believe in Patient Education first and foremost. This is why we've created a library of educational content about the medicinal use of cannabis, at our <a href="/learning-hub">Medicinal Cannabis Learning Hub</a>.</p>
            <p>Cannabis has been shown to be an effective therapeutic option for a range of ailments. See the info cards in this section for some of the most common medical conditions for which cannabis can be used as a therapeutic treatment option.</p>
